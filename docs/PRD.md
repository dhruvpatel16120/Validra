## 1. Product Overview & Vision

**Validra** is an AI-assisted packaged commodity compliance checking system designed to inspect packaged consumer goods against the statutory requirements of India's:
- **Legal Metrology Act, 2009**
- **Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011** (and applicable amendments)

Validra automates image quality assessment, label preprocessing, OCR text recognition, structured field extraction (MRP, Net Quantity, Dates, Manufacturer/Packer details, Consumer Care), deterministic rule engine validation, spatial evidence localization, and tamper-evident compliance report generation.

> 🏆 **Smart India Hackathon 2026** — Problem Statement ID: **26034**  
> 👥 **Team:** VisionMinds — Think. Build. Transform.

### Core Operating Principle

> **AI extracts and assists → Rules evaluate deterministically → Human reviews uncertain cases.**

Validra is explicitly designed as an enforcement decision-support system. It never allows autonomous AI models to issue legal verdicts; deterministic rule logic evaluates compliance, and legal officers review and sign off on all findings.

## 4. Legal Metrology Compliance Checks Matrix (C01 to C26)

The deterministic Rule Engine evaluates packages against 26 compliance checks derived from the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011:

| Check ID | Declaration / Rule Requirement | Legal Reference | CV-Verifiable? | Rule Engine Logic |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **C01** | Package applicability & exemption check | Rule 3, 26 | Partially | Evaluates weight/volume thresholds; checks packages ≤ 10g/ml exemption |
| **C02** | Manufacturer name declaration | Rule 6, 10 | ✅ | Verifies presence of registered manufacturing corporate entity |
| **C03** | Manufacturer complete address | Rule 6, 10 | ✅ | Verifies geographic location, state/city, and postal code |
| **C04** | Packer name and address (if distinct) | Rule 6, 10 | ✅ | Checks packer entity if different from manufacturer |
| **C05** | Importer details (if foreign product) | Rule 6, 10 | ✅ | Mandatory country of origin and registered importer details |
| **C06** | Common / generic commodity name | Rule 6(1)(b) | ✅ | Verifies commodity nomenclature matches standard retail classification |
| **C07** | Multipack individual product naming | Rule 6(1)(b) | ✅ | Validates itemization in multi-piece consumer packaging |
| **C08** | Net quantity declaration present | Rule 6, 11 | ✅ | Validates presence of numerical net quantity |
| **C09** | Correct measurement unit for commodity | Rule 12, 13 | ✅ | Verifies weight (g/kg), volume (ml/l), or length (m/cm) by commodity type |
| **C10** | Standard SI units compliance | Rule 13 | ✅ | Prohibits non-metric terms (dozen, gross, lbs, ounces) |
| **C11** | Month & year of mfg / packing / import | Rule 6(1)(d) | ✅ | Regex validation for valid MM/YYYY, MMM-YYYY, or date format |
| **C12** | MRP declaration present | Rule 6(1)(e) | ✅ | Verifies presence of Indian Rupee symbol (₹ / Rs.) and numerical price |
| **C13** | MRP inclusive of all taxes declaration | Rule 6(1)(e) | ✅ | Verifies mandatory text: "inclusive of all taxes" / "incl. of all taxes" |
| **C14** | Package physical dimensions | Rule 6(1)(f), 14–17 | ✅ | Verifies size declarations where required for textiles/cables |
| **C15** | Consumer care contact details | Rule 6(2) | ✅ | Verifies presence of helpline phone, email address, and physical contact |
| **C16** | Principal Display Panel (PDP) placement | Rule 7, 8 | Partially | Checks location of mandatory declarations relative to label surface |
| **C17** | Quantity numeral minimum height | Rule 7 | ⚠️ Relative | Measures relative pixel height; flags for verification if borderline |
| **C18** | Declaration letter minimum height | Rule 7 | ⚠️ Relative | Checks text height ratios against package bounding area |
| **C19** | Quantity clear space surrounding | Rule 8 | Partially | Spatial check ensuring no overlapping artwork or text crowding |

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

### 5.1 Performance & Latency Budgets
- **Client Upload Latency**: Immediate client-side format/size validation (< 50ms).
- **Full Scan Pipeline Execution**: End-to-end processing (Quality → RGB Preprocessing → EasyOCR → Groq Extraction → Rule Evaluation) completed within **10–15 seconds** for multi-panel package scans.
- **UI Responsiveness**: Initial page loads < 1.5s; client UI transitions < 100ms via Next.js App Router and Server Components.

### 5.2 Confidence Gating & Quality Assurance
- Every extracted field carries an explicit confidence score `[0.0, 1.0]`.
- OCR/Extraction confidence threshold:
  - `≥ 0.85`: High confidence (eligible for automated PASS).
  - `< 0.85`: Automatically triggers `NEEDS_REVIEW` state requiring human review.
- Low-quality images (blur, glare, resolution < 1024px) fail fast at the Quality Gate (`quality_failed`) before burning compute.

### 5.3 Security, Auth & RBAC
- FastAPI independently validates JWT signature, expiration, and role permissions on every protected endpoint.
- Administrator accounts are provisioned via secure server CLI scripts; no public administrative signup.
- Passwords hashed using bcrypt/argon2; all API communications encrypted over HTTPS/TLS.

### 5.4 Data Integrity & Tamper-Evidence
- Original uploaded images hashed with SHA-256 upon receipt.
- Finalized PDF reports stamped with document SHA-256 hash and dynamic verification QR code pointing to `https://validra.app/verify/{report_code}`.
- Immutable `audit_logs` record all inspector overrides and admin rule modifications.
